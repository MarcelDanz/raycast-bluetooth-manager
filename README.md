# Bluetooth Manager for Raycast

A Raycast extension to quickly connect and disconnect your Bluetooth devices directly from the Raycast command bar.

## Requirements

This extension requires `blueutil`, a command-line utility to control Bluetooth connections on macOS.

To use this extension, you must have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. The first time you run `npm install` for this extension, it will automatically attempt to install `blueutil` for you using Homebrew.

## Features

- **List Devices**: View all paired Bluetooth devices at a glance.
- **Connection Status**: Instantly see which devices are connected or disconnected.
- **Toggle Connection**: Connect or disconnect any device with a single action (`â†µ`).
- **Smart Ranking**: Raycast automatically learns which devices you use most and ranks them higher in the list.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use `Cmd`+`Ctrl`+`J` and `Cmd`+`Ctrl`+`K` to navigate the list.
